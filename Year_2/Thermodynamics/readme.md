# Project: Thermodynamics Snookered

## Modern description of gas links to classical thermodynamics:
* KE: Temp
* Force due to atoms colliding with container: Pressure 

## Main Aim: 
* 2-D simulation of a gas and animate it to illustrate and investigate these links

### Project Aims:
* Write a code to describe a single ball bouncing inside a circular container
* Incorporate this into an animation
* Extend the code to include multiple balls
* Calculate the temperature and pressure
* Study the effects of varying the various parameters to deduce the basic laws of thermodynamics
